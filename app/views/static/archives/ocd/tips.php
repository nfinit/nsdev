<h4 align="center">Searching tips</h4>
<p>The OCD can be searched using the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Vendor drop-down:</i> Selecting a vendor with no keyphrase will display a summary of that vendor, and all catalogued system configurations corresponding to it.</li>
<li><i>Global keyphrase search:</i> The OCD can also be searched in its entirety using a keyphrase from which individual words are matched to records, or larger phrases contained in quotes. Also of use to further refine searches are the directives <b>'vendor:'</b>, <b>'system:'</b>, <b>'config:'</b> and <b>'extras:'</b>, which limit word/phrase matching to their corresponding columns.</li>
<li><i>Both:</i> Keyphrase searching can also be performed on systems only from a specific vendor using the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search terms are included in a query by 'AND', meaning that a search in Silicon Graphics systems with the keyphrase 'system:750 config:2x' will return all dual-processor SGI 750 configurations. Explicit 'OR' will be added in future revisions of the OCD engine.</p>
