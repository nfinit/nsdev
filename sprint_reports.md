# Sprint updates

**4 October 2017**

Due to time constraints and other obligations, the project is currently behind schedule and not as much has been accomplished as I had  hoped.

This initial sprint was mostly intended to smooth groundwork laid for this project in CS 401, such as the merger of separate site features such as the personal collection database and OEM Configuration Database (OCD) into the more generic and generally useful Collection Management System/CMS SysBase, as well as streamlining the rudimentary article system.

The biggest challenge I faced was finding an economical hosting solution that suited my needs and goals for the project, since at first the basic AWS hosting I had intended to use did not play well with the Laravel framework I originally intended to use. Instead, I have elected to utilize the lighter weight CodeIgniter framework that also has the added benefit of being PHP 5.6 compatible, allowing the final result of this project to be moved between and deployed on a wider variety of systems (this site was originally intended to be run from a Solaris/SPARC host at home)

With the hosting issues resolved, I feel I will attain the goals I laid out for this sprint quickly, although the basic site components and styles still need to be adapted to the new framework, as well as existing databases.
