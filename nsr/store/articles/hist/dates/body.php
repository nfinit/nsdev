<h1 align="center">Adding context with hardware dating</h1><hr>

<p>Depending on <i>what</i> and <i>why</i> you collect, it may 
  be interesting to you to further investigate when a system or component was 
  actually built. There are a few reasons, some practical and others subjective, 
  one may want to do so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You're looking for a specific hardware revision, or a specific run of components 
    that may not be immediately identifiable otherwise</li>
  <li>You want to determine if your setup is stock, or was upgraded at some point in time</li>
  <li>In a similar vein, you want to add <i>context</i> to your system; was it 
    top-of-the-line when it was purchased, or was it made later in its production 
    lifetime, after it had been succeeded by newer models?</li>
  <li>You're intending to use the system as a prop or in some other way in which 
    the more specific timeframe than the series' general production lifetime may 
    be important</li>
  <li>You otherwise simply want to add more backstory to your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever reasons you chose (or didn't), this article presents a few simple 
  methods to obtain a more specific range of dates in which your system may have 
  been built, or even a perfectly accurate date, using design, hardware features 
  as well as the many various date codes printed on components and systems alike 
  by most chipmakers and vendors.</p>

<h2 align="center">Direct dating</h2>
<p align="center">These are generally the most reliable methods of dating electronics, 
  using the various dates printed on the system or its components by system and 
  chip manufacturers. Depending on the format of the date, one can acertain the 
  exact age of their system, sometimes even to the time of day.</p>
<p align="center">However, there are some caveats, <b>most of these methods work 
  best with "prebuilt" OEM electronics</b>, as the components they order 
  are usually quickly put into full assemblies soon after they're recieved. This 
  can also be true of smaller outfits or home-assembled equipment, but it may 
  not be fully accurate due to factors such as components that were purchased 
  second-hand, or usage of leftover stock. If you have a "whitebox" 
  system that was built by an individual or a local computer store, it's recommended 
  to also use this in combination with other methods to estimate its age.</p>

<h3>Date of manufacture</h3>
<p>By far the most obvious and straightforward method, some (but not all) vendors 
  will simply print the exact date at which the product left the factory, sometimes 
  even down to the specific time of day. A number of larger vendors have practiced 
  this to some capacity, although not always consistently.</p>
<p>Some of those I know to practice this are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apple (~1995-1998 beige PPC systems)</li>
  <li>Hewlett-Packard ("original" Vectra line up to ~1994)</li>
  <li>IBM/Lenovo (mostly on later ThinkPad systems)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other manufacturers, specifically <b>Dell</b>, may provide a date of manufacture 
  for systems online which can be accessed by providing the system's service tag 
  (in the case of Dell systems).</p>
<h3>Year and week number codes</h3>
<p>While most vendors don't provide the kind of accurate dating above, the DoM 
  on most systems based on integrated circuits can be approximated within one 
  or two months, or even more accurately using more commonly available year and 
  week number date codes which are carried on pretty much any sizable IC made 
  during or after the 1970s, maybe even before. Remember, however, that the ordering 
  and presentation can and does still differ between various vendors, and in some 
  cases it may even be obscured within a larger serial number.</p>
<p>These kinds of codes can be somewhat more difficult to discern a more commonly 
  formatted date from immediately, based on the week of the year (from 1 to 52) 
  rather than a specific day or month, as an example, this table shows week ranges 
  and their corresponding months for the year 2017:</p>

<p>While the overall ranges are mostly static from year to year and the above 
  table can be used to establish a ballpark estimate, their exact constrants can 
  still vary depending on things such as the day the month began on, leap years 
  or other factors, thus it's recommended to use an online week calendar or other 
  resource to get an exact calendar corresponding to a specific year.</p>
<h3>Four-digit codes</h3>
<p>Four-digit year/week codes are easily the most common among the majority of 
  component vendors, often appearing by themselves on individual chips and sometimes 
  entire assemblies. By observing the range of these codes, one can pin down a 
  rough DoM for practically any system (so long as it was assembled from entirely 
  new parts in a reasonable timeframe after they were recieved), or at get least 
  enough information to add reasonable context. </p>
<p>On top of the reasonable resolution offered by this method, it's also easy 
  to recognize quickly, shared among most ICs in an assembly and displaying a 
  noticable pattern that can be referenced with other chips; if you aren't sure 
  if what you're looking at is a date code, you can check if other chips share 
  similar four-digit markings.</p>
<p>These date codes vary in their format from manufacturer to manufacturer, appearing 
  in either year/week order (e.g. <b><font color="red">84</font><font color="green">05</font></b> 
  for <b><font color="green">week 5</font></b> 
  of <b><font color="red">1984</font></b>) or 
  week/year order (presented as <b><font color="green">05</font><font color="red">84</font></b> 
  for the same date) mostly equally as common.</p>
<h3>Embedded and special code formats</h3>
<p>Some vendors date their products with markings that are noticably different 
  from the more common four-digit format, although they are still fundamentally 
  similar.</p>
<p>Intel is one of the most notable examples of this kind of practice, in most 
  of their microprocessors and chipsets mader after around the mid-1980s employing 
  a monolithic serial number that conveys the year and week of manufacture as 
  well as other information such as the plant of origin. The year/week-formatted 
  date section of an Intel serial number differs from the above format in that 
  it omits the decade of manufacture from the year, so, as an example, a chip 
  manufactured in <b><font color="green">week 28</font></b> of <font color="red"><b>1995</b></font> 
  would carry the code <b></b> <font color="red"><b>5</b></font><b><font color="green">28</font></b>, 
  rather than <b><font color="red">95</font><font color="green">28</font></b>. 
  Luckily, this consideration does not provide too much of an obstacle for dating 
  a chip, as changes in packaging and branding can make the decade easily discernible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center">Styles, ideas and specifications</h2>
<p align="center">The direct dating methods above often provide most of the information one may need to get the "full story" behind their system, however it is far from infallable, as upgrades and servicing can muddle with results, while smaller outfits and individuals may not always be consistent in the age of their stock. As a result, it's often wise to examine the system in other ways, such as its design paradigms, considerations, features that may further give away its age.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the kinds of things to consider when using the methods this section discusses are generally broad and vary wildly between various kinds of electronics where design considerations can differ. This section will focus primarily on small computer systems, though much of it can be extrapolated to other kinds of electronics.</p>
