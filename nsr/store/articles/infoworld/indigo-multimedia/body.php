<p>Silicon Graphics Inc. is offering a combination of hardware and software tools that allows users to work with two- and three-dimensional images, video, audio and text. The products are an indicuation of SGI's commitment to Digital Media as a core technology.</p>
<img src="img/infoworld-indigo-multi.GIF" title="SGI Indigo" alt="The Indigo workstation is the basis of a new foray into the desktop multimedia market by Silicon Graphics." align="right">
<p>Addressing its comprehensive multimedia solution, SGI has introduced the IndigoVideo board, a 24-bit video card capable of capturing 24-bit single-frame video images or real-time RGB signals in 8-bit mode.</p>
<p>The board supports NTSC or PAL broadcast signals and can accept input directly from videotape, video cameras, or laserdisk players. The board will ship in June and will be priced at $2,500.</p>
<p>SGI will also offer a family of audio and video libraries, similar to the Iris Graphics Library, that includes seven programming modules available as part of SGI's Digital Media Developer Kit.</p>
<p>The $495 set of modules includes a programming interface for audio, IndigoVideo, compression, MIDI, and the soruce code for Iris Showcase.</p>
<p>SGI is also supporting hardware and software products from third-party developers, including the MMI-110 Stereo Audio Processor from Vigra Inc. that is designed to work with SGI's new audio libraries.</p>
<p>Vigra's sound board can support external input from a variety of external audio devices including CD players and tape recorders and supports digital filtering and sampling rates from 8 kHz to 48 kHz. The company expects to ship its Stereo Audio Processor in August, at a list price of less than $2,000.</p>
<p>As part of its multimedia push, SGI has also introduced a 3-D toolkit - Iris Inventor - designed to simplify the development of complex graphics.</p>
<p>The toolkit combines a universal file exchange protocol, the Inventor File Format, to enable developers to cut and paste 3-D images with SGI's Graphics Library.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the toolkit is expected to expand the number of 3-D graphics applications by making ti easier for users to transfer data between applications.</p>
<p>Iris inventor is scheduled to start shipping this summer and will have a list price of $495. The toolkit will also be compatible with SGI's OpenGL, which SGI is licensing to other hardware developers.</p>
<p>SGI has also introduced a server version of its Iris Indigo workstation.</p>
<p>The server product uses a MIPS R3000A RISC processor and is capable of performing as many as 30 million instructions per second, according to the company. It comes with 8 megabytes of memory, built-in Ethernet connectivity, and has a total storage capacity of 8.4 gigabytes.</p>
<p>List price for a base-model Indigo server is $6,400.</p>
