<p>Silicon Graphics Inc. will introduce three new models to its Iris Indigo RISC workstations, choosing to fill out the line with more power and graphics capabilities rather than lowering prices below the Indigo's $7,995 base price.</p>
<p>At a time when most workstation companies are focused on introducing entry-level systems for less than $5,000, SGI instead is increasing the three-dimensional graphics capabilities of its Indigo line to include true 24-bit graphics and improving performance by adding its proprietary graphics engine chip to the line.</p>
<p>The new Indigo workstations include the Indigo XS, with 16 megabytes of memory, a 16-inch color monitor, an optional Z-buffer in hardware, and the capability to support a resolution of 1,280 by 1,024.</p>
<p>The Indigo XS24, SGI's first true 24-bit color system, sports the same configuration as the XS. The XS24 is aimed primarily at markets, such as desktop publishing and medical imaging, that demand true 24-bit color.</p>
<p>The original Indigo and the XS support virtual 24-bit color with 16-bits of color and an 8-bit frame buffer.</p>
<p>At the high end of the line, SGI introduced the Indigo Elan, which is configured similarly to the XS and the XS24. The Elan offers ebtween three to four times the 3-D graphics processing capabilities of the other new Indigo models, the company said.</p>
<p>The XS and XS24 are capable of supporting 250,000 3-D vectors, 25,000 3-D quads, and as many as 60,000 3-D polygons. By contrast, the Elan supports as many as 1 million vectors, 100,000 quads, and 225,000 polygons.</p>
<p>SGI's original Indigo with the graphics engine in software was limited to supporting 231,000 3-D vectors, 6,600 quads, and 14,000 polygons.</p>
<p>The difference is that the Elan, configured with true 24-bit color, a 19-inch monitor, and priced at $27,000, comes configured with three SGI graphics engines. The $13,000 XS and the $15,000 XS24 come with just one graphics engine chip.</p>
<p>The XS and XS24 are scheduled to ship in April. The Elan expects to ship in March.</p>
