<p>Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) is expected to announce a new high-end version of its Indigo2 desktop workstation on Monday.</p>
<p>SGI's latest workstation will be based on a new NEC Technologies Inc. R4400 processor running at 250 MHz, sources familiar with the product said. The system's performance has been estimated at 170 SPECint92 and 175 SPECfp92, these sources added.</p>
<p>Pricing for the workstation is expected to start in the mid-$40,000 range for a model with 64MB of RAM, a 2-gigabyte hard drive, and a 20-inch monitor.</p>
<p>The 250-MHz R4400 will offer better integer performance than the 75-MHz R8000, currently SGI's highest performance Indigo system.</p>
<p>That increased integer performance will also improve the system's overall floating-point performance, sources said. Although the R8000's floating-point unit is faster than the R4400's, its poor integer performance hinders the system's overall performance, sources said.</p>
<p>Another advantage to SGI's moving to the 4400 chip for its high-performance Indigo, sources said, is that the R44400 line has a larger application base than the R8000.</p>
<p>The announcement of the computer comes on the heels of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s introduction of its J-class workstations, which are being marketed to compete against the Indigo2.</p>
<p>As HP did with its J-class line, SGI is also expected to announce new graphics adapters along with the new workstations.</p>
<p>SGI declined to comment on the announcement.</p>
