<p>Silicon Graphics is trying to claw its way into the mainstream workstaiton marketplace with its Indigo personal workstation.</p>
<img src="img/infoworld-indigo-3D.GIF" title="SGI Indigo" alt="If Silicon Graphics' Indigo workstation does its job, Sun will have a new competitor for the low end of the workstation market." align="right">
<p>At $7,995, the Indigo features SGI's trademark 3-D graphics and a strong audio component with five audio connections, a microphone and DAT-quality sound, along with a 16-inch color monitor and 8 megabytes of memory. A 236-megabyte hard drive costs and additional $2,000.</p>
<p>The system is powered by a 33-MHz R3000 from Mips Computer Systems, which can perform 30 million instructions per second. Silicon Graphics promises Indigo will be compatible with future ACE operating systems, making it the first in a line of "RISC personal computers" said Ed McCracken, president of SGI.</p>
<p>For the near future, SGI, which sells $600 million worth of high-end graphics products annulaly, hopes the workstation will broaden its market base to include mainstream workstation users, such as CASE, CAD/CAM, and color publishing.</p>
<p>"We're not really going after the commercial marketplace at this point," said Michael Ramsey, general manager and vice president of SGI's entry systems devision. We're really looking to expand our presence in traditional scientific/engineering markets."</p>
<p>Several crucial developers announced new products for Indigo, including Autodesk with AutoCAD, Release 11; Adobe Illustrator; WordPerfect 5.0 for Unix; and MacroMind Inc.'s Director.</p>
<p>Most of those products, however, aren't expected to ship until later this year or in 1992. For many observers the software offerings won't support SGI's goal of competing head-to-head against Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>"Where's the mainstream applications, where's the DOS connectivity, where's the Macintosh connectivity?" asked Dataquest analyst Andy Seybold. "I think Silicon Graphics made a big mistake by not addressing these concerns before they announced the product. That's going to keep them from achieving what they want."</p>
