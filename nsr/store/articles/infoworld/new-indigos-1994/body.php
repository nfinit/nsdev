<hr>
<p>Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) added three models to its Indigo lineup last week, including a version designed to excel at floating point calculations.</p>
<p>The Power Indigo2 uses the 64-bit MIPS Technologies Inc. RISC R8000 processor and is designed for scientific and technical applications, including computational analysis, manufacturing, chemistry, and oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p>The 75-MHz R8000 includes 2MB of cache. It has a SPECint92 rating of 108 and a SPECfp92 rating of 270.</p>
<p>The Power Indigo2 is available with either SGI's Extreme or XZ graphics subsystem. It uses the Irix 6.0 operating environment with the 64-bit Unix System V, Release 4, operating system.</p>
<p>Power Indigo2 systems are due to ship in the fourth quarter of this year. Pricing starts at $46,000 for a system with 64MB of RAM, a 2-gigabyte hard drive, a 19-inch monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse.</p>
<p>SGI also introduced an Indigo workstation based on a 200-MHz version of its R4400SC microprocessor. Previously, the chip ran at 150 MHz.</p>
<p>The company also introduced a model based on the 133-MHz R4600SC processor. The Indigo2 R4400SC is rated at 119 SPECint92 and 131 SPECfp 92, while the Indigo2 R4600SC is rated at 109 SPECint92 and 72 SPECfp92.</p>
<p>Both systems are available now.</p>
<p>A 133-MHz R4600SC-based system with 24-bit XO graphics, 32MB of RAM, a 1-gigabyte hard drive, a 19-inch monitor, Irix 5.2 operating environment, a keyboard, and a mouse lists for $21,500.</p>
<p>A similarly configured 200-MHz R4400SC-based system lists for $24,500.</p>
<p>Current Indigo2 users will be able to upgrade to the Power Indigo2, Indigo2 R4400SC, or Indigo2 R4600SC.</p>
