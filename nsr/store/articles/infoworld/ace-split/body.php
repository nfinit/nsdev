<p>Does anyone still care about ACE? That's the question some analysts were asking in the wake of Compaq Computer Corp.'s break with Silicon Graphics Inc. last week and the ending of their joint RISC development efforts.</p>
<p>"I think they will still use the term ACE, but the Advanced Computing Environment, as we know it, is gone," said Bruce Lupatkin, technology analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment banking firm.</p>

<p>Announced with a flourish last April, ACE began as a consortium of 21 companies - led by Compaq - which promised to build and promote a new architecture using the MIPS R4000 RISC processor.</p>
<p>"A significant amount of momentum has drained away from ACE," said Bruce Stephen, PC analyst at International Data Corp., in Framingham, Massachusetts. The Compaq/SGI breakup "pricks another hole in the ACE balloon, which was already losing air."</p>
<p>Analysts said ACE will continue as an individual effort of companies to use the R4000 processor rather than a consortium building compatible machines. Some also saw the aborted SGI venture as a victim of cost-cutting at Compaq.</p>
<p>"The agreement with SGI was put in place when Compaq was under different management," said Jeff Canin, technology analyst at Montgomery Securities.</p>
<p>Canin said the SGI deal fell apart because new Compaq CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer has moved the company away from the high-end 3-D systems SGI builds.</p>
<p>SGI president Ed McCracken said the breakup was simply a case of two companies who simply couldn't get along and cautioned that nothing more should be read into it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Compaq's move came at a bad time for ACE. Digital Equipment Corp., the other ACE hardware champion, already has four workstation platforms and isn't dependent on ACE becoming a success, Canin said.</p>
<p>The success of SGI's Indigo workstations, at prices beginning at about $8,000, could also have helped sour the Compaq deal.</p>
<p>Compaq, SGI, and Digital reaffirmed their commitments to ACE. But skeptics contend the proposed new architecture could be in more danger than the ACE companies are willing to admit.</p>
