<h1 align="center">DECpc XL Series: Three Platforms In One System</h1>

<hr>
<p>With all the talk about Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) technology bringing workstation power to the desktop, high-end PC buyers are beginning to face some tough buying decisions. Which platform is the right one? 486? Pentium? RISC?</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corp.'s latest line of high-end personal computers, the DECpc XL Series, tackles this problem head on by being very upgradable. In fact, Digital is going so far as to bill it as "the most upgradable PC on the planet."</p>
<p>That hype has some basis in fact. The DECpc XL family can be upgraded through three different processor classes. Systems can start out with Intel 33-MHz 486 processors, get upgraded to 60- or 66-MHz Pentium processors, and eventually (perhaps by June) will even be able to take advantage of Digital's own Alpha XP RISC chip.</p>
<p>That kind of flexibility is attractive for buyers who want to hedge their bets, for while the Pentium processor has many RISC characteristics, it keeps the register structure of the 80x86 series of processors instead of using the large register files of true RISC chips. That leads to performance differences.</p>
<h2>Impressive design</h2>
<p>We looked at a $3,999 60-MHz Pentium-based DECpc XL 560 and found its engineering and design impressive. All the models in the family are well-equipped enough to satisfy even the most power-hungry appetites. A DECpc XL 433DX outfitted with a 486/33 chip costs $2,899. Also available are the $3,299 DECpc XL 466d2 and the $4,599 DECpc XL 566. Monitors are not included in these prices.</p><img src="img/pcmag-decpcxl-560.GIF" title="DECpc XL 560" alt="The DECpc XL packs a lot of upgradability into a relatively small package." align="right">
<p>There is only one case design: a 17-by-7-by-17-inch (HWD) minitower that's the direct descendant of the DECpc MTE family. The system has a PCI/ISA-based motherboard, a ZIF processor socket, two buffered serial ports, an external SCSI-2 port, and a 300-watt 3.3V ready power supply. Along with one internal and four front-accessible storage bays, there are three available SIA slots, two PCI slots, and one PCI/ISA slot. All the CPU logic is placed on a daughtercard to make upgrading as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Also inside are two variable speed fans that can sense excessive heat and activate themselves automatically. One of the fans sends air directly along the CPU daughtercard.</p>
<p>To speed performance, Digital has implemented a 128K external writeback cache directly on its 486 daughtercards. That cache wasn't available on the Pentium-based unit we tested, but it's expected soon.</p>
<h2>Strong performance</h2>
<p>The DECpc 560 we tested came with 8MB of 70-ns RAM (expandable to 192MB), a 340MB SCSI hard disk (525MB and 1GB options), a 1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy disk, S3-928 PCI-based local-bus video with 1MB of VRAM, and a double-speed SCSI CD-ROM drive.</p>
<p>The system's overall results on our entire suite of tests are good when compared with the historical average of all Pentium PCs we've evaluated, and in a couple of cases, very good. Using the PCI-based local-bus video card to its best advantage, the DECpc turned in excellent DOS Video and Graphics WinMark scores (3,744.4 and 19.3, respectively). The Diamond Viper PCI video subsystem is available as an option for those who need even better video performance than the S3 chip can offer.</p>
<h2>Past Pentium</h2>
<p>Digital isn't alone in looking past the Pentium for the future. Because of the promise of Windows NT, a number of computer chip manufacturers, not just IBM, are beginning to develop RISC-based processors that will take advantage of the NT operating system on PCI/ISA-based computer architectures.</p>
<p>1994 promises to be a year in which the characteristics of what makes a great high-end PC change and then change again.</p>
<p>No matter what happens with the ultimate success of NT and RISC prcessors, Digital's DECpc XL Series is well positioned to meet the needs of high-end PC shoppers, whichever way they intend to go in the future.</p>
